Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "writeonce, runanywhere" (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Javavirtualmachine (JVM) regardless of computerarchitecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popularprogramminglanguagesinuse, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
NEED FOR OOP PARADIGM
• The  object  oriented  paradigm  is  a  methodology  for  producing  reusable  softwarecomponents 
• The object-oriented paradigm is a programming methodology that promotes the efficientdesign  and  development  of  software  systems  using  reusable  components  that  can  bequickly and safely assembled into larger systems. 
• Object oriented programming has taken a completely different direction and will place an emphasis   on object s and information. With object   oriented programming, a problemwill be broken down into a number of units .these are  called objects .The foundation ofoop is the fact that it will place an emphasis on objects and classes. There are number ofadvantages   to  be  found  with  using  the  oop   paradigm,  and  some  of  these  are  oop paradigm.
 • Object  oriented  programming  is  a  concept  that  was  created  because  of  the  need  toovercome  the  problems  that  were  found  with  using  structured  programming  techniques.  While  structured  programming  uses  an  approach  which  is  top  down,  oop  uses  an  approach which is bottom up. 
• A paradigm is a way in which a computer language looks at the problem to be solved.  Wedivide  computer  languages  into  four  paradigms:  procedural, object-oriented,functional and declarative
